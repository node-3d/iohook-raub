```console
npm i -s iohook-raub
```

**Node.js** addon providing a hook to track global input and shortcuts.
This work is derived from [wilix-team/iohook](https://github.com/wilix-team/iohook).

> Note: this **addon uses N-API**, and therefore is ABI-compatible across different
Node.js versions. Addon binaries are precompiled and **there is no compilation**
step during the `npm i` command.

See [TypeScript declarations](/index.d.ts) for more details.
