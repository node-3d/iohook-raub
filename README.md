```console
npm install @node-3d/iohook
```

**Node.js** addon providing a hook to track global input and shortcuts.
This work is derived from [wilix-team/iohook](https://github.com/wilix-team/iohook).

```ts
import { iohook } from '@node-3d/iohook';

iohook.on('keydown', (event) => {
	console.log(event.keycode);
});

iohook.shortcut([29, 65], (keys) => {
	console.log('Shortcut pressed with keys:', keys);
});

iohook.start();
```

> Note: this **addon uses N-API**, and therefore is ABI-compatible across different
Node.js versions. Addon binaries are precompiled and **there is no compilation**
step during the `npm install` command.
